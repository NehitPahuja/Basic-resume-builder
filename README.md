## Deploy

Because it’s static, you can deploy anywhere:

* Vercel: Import repo → deploy (the demo is hosted on Vercel).
* GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from `main` → `/ (root)`
* Netlify: Drag & drop or connect repo

---

## Roadmap Ideas

* Multiple templates (classic, modern, minimalist)
* Section reordering + drag & drop
* Dark mode toggle
* Auto-save to LocalStorage
* Custom theme colors and font picker

Do you also want me to **add shields.io badges** (like Tech Stack, Live Demo, Stars, Forks) at the top for a more professional look?
